type checking


garbage collecting reactive
    have each reactive keep track of its "parent" reactive(s)


make a shortcut for setting style- properties


actions
event capturing


syntax additions
  f:each
  f:on (in progress)


design decisions:
  figure out how/if i want to do "lazy" template calls (so that reactive values are just passed in instead of reapplying the template when they change)
  should f:on be an attribute or child of an element?
  figure out how to refer to a reactive value within an action (ie: to set it)









Write a project description, etc.:

  mbrella is a framework for programming real-time collaborative web apps in a declarative, functional-reactive way.

  Applications:
    prototyping puzzle games
